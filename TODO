  > Mail::SPF
    * [DONE?] Fix the RFC 4408 POD references.
    * Support "max_failed_dns_lookups" limit option in Mail::SPF::Server (default
      to undef).
    ! Resolve remaining XXXs, FIXMEs, and TODOs:
      grep -rn 'XXX\|TODO\|FIXME' lib | grep -v '\.svn' | less
    * Increase version number.
    * Update changelogs.
    * Close/fix rt.cpan.org bugs.

    Non-essential:
    * Implement DNS cache.
    * Remove or conditionalize debug output generation.  Add more debug code?
    ? Store the SPF record object (which one?) (and the matched mechanism?) in
      the result object. (Needed?)

  > spfquery
    + Enable/implement 'sanitize' and 'debug' options.
    + Implement black magic options.

  Please DO report documentation bugs, as there certainly are some!

  > Mail::SPF
    + Add a "priority" class property to global modifier classes that defines
      the order in which different global modifier types should be processed.
      (This might also serve to _explicitly_ ensure that "redirect=" always
      gets processed after any "exp=" within a given record.  Currently, this
      is not actually guaranteed.  But this is only a design wart and does not
      cause any bugs.)
