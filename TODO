  > Mail::SPF
    * Support "max_failed_dns_lookups" limit option in Mail::SPF::Server (default
      to undef).
    + Add a "priority" class property to global modifier classes that defines
      the order in which different global modifier types should be processed.
      (This might also serve to _explicitly_ ensure that "redirect=" always
      gets processed after any "exp=" within a given record.  Currently, this
      is not actually guaranteed.  But this is only a design wart and does not
      cause any bugs.)
    * Implement DNS cache.  Revert changes to the Mail::SPF::Server's
      "DESCRIPTION" POD section in r36.
    * Remove or conditionalize debug output generation.  Add more debug code?
    ! Resolve remaining XXXs, FIXMEs, and TODOs:
      grep -rn 'XXX\|TODO\|FIXME' lib | grep -v '\.svn' | less
    * Increase version number.
    * Update changelogs.
