mail-spf-perl (2.003) unstable; urgency=low

  Mail::SPF:
  * Fixed two Perl 5.6 incompatibilities:
    * Added `use utf8` statements in several modules to keep Perl 5.6 from
      whining about /[\p{}]/.
    * Do not use the `use constant { a=>1, b=>2 }` multiple-constants idiom,
      as it was introduced only in constant 1.03 (Perl 5.7.2).
  * Fixed a very minor bug where a "TempError" result would incorrectly be
    returned in the very rare case when the SPF-type look-up succeeded but
    returned 0 records, and the following TXT-type look-up errored or timed
    out.  Now a "None" result is correctly returned in that case as demanded
    by RFC 4408.

  spfquery:
  * Minor documentation fixes.

mail-spf-perl (2.002) unstable; urgency=low

  Mail::SPF:
  * Updated default authority explanation string to the SPF website's new
    "Why?" page URL parameters scheme:
    <http://www.openspf.org/Why?id=%{S}&ip=%{I}&receiver=%{R}>

  spfquery:
  * Updated the '--help' text and man-page with regard to the black magic
    options (which require the yet unreleased Mail::SPF::BlackMagic module).
